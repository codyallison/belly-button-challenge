Hello, 

In this repository you will find code for module 14 Washington University/edX data analytics bootcamp.
-The samples.json is the primary source of data that will be presented in the final dashboard (index.html)
-The index.html will run the js, html, css code for the final presentation
-the static folder contains the app.js file. 

In the app.js folder you will find code that reads data from the sample website below: 
The code will then populate a dropdown and create metadata table and 3 charts on the data available to that sample. 

the bar chart shows the top 10 OTUs for each sample
the bubble chart helps display OTU distribution for each sample
and the gauge chart shows the frequency of weekly washings per sample.
